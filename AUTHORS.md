The last one which served as basis for version control, under SVN then migrated to Git, was the `20090306_ela` release by Edouard Lafargue. See the first commit of this repository.

Since then, each contribution is tracked by the Git history. See the output of `git shortlog -nse` for a full list. See also [the Contributors page on Github](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/graphs/contributors).
